           <p>Hello there, I am Ayberk Akıcı, a professional Front-End Web Developer from İstanbul, Turkey. I have extensive knowledge in web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript (mostly in Jquery library). Essentially, I use web tools such as; Dreamweaver, Coda, Visual Studio to code, Photoshop for visual tasks and firebug for debugging. Drupal (my favourite open source CMS) and Wordpress are the key CMS’ implemented due to administrative needs in my projects. Some of the methodologies and strategies I follow up are Responsive Design, UX Design, Wireframing, Content Prototyping, Usabilty, Accessibilty, Graceful Degradation, Progressive Enhancement, Semantic Markup and SEO. Although my key skills are front-end technologies, I can obviously say that I am involved in all phases of a web project from planning to testing and once completed, its maintenance.</p>
